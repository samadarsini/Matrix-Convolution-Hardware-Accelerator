# Matrix Convolution Hardware Accelerator
Developed a matrix convolution hardware accelerator using Finite State Machine and Avalon-MM interface, integrating FPGA- based processing for efficient computation. Validated the design through hardware-software co-design, and analyzed the effect of acceleration on a part of algorithm using the FPGA De1-SOC board.
